 `"end"`  refers to the bottom in a horizontal layout, and right in a vertical LTR layout
 `"start"`  and  `"end"`  reverse places when in a vertical layout in a RTL locale.
This includes support shorthand for combining  `align-items`  and  `justify-content`  into
a single property, separated by a space, in that order. This allows you to specify both
the horizontal and vertical alignment in one property, separated by a space.
 * 
 * For example,  `align="center space-between"`  means  `align-items: center`  and
 `justify-content: space-between`  for each.  `justify-content`  property can be used to
align the Cells on the main axis and adjust gaps among the Cells. To declare the
 `justify-content`  property only, just add a heading space for  `align`  prop string like
 `align=" space-between"` . The default value for  `align-items`  is  `stretch` . It can be
also used for  `align`  prop like  `align="stretch space-between"` . All values of
 `justify-content`  are supported, like  `start` ,  `end` ,  `center` ,  `space-between` ,
 `space-around` , and  `space-evenly` .
 * ```
<Layout align="center space-around">
    <Cell>Left Column</Cell>
    <Cell>Right Column</Cell>
